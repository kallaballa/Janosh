### jsoncons::wjson

```c++
typedef basic_json<wchar_t,
                   ImplementationPolicy = sorted_policy,
                   Allocator = std::allocator<wchar_t>> wjson
```
The `wjson` class is an instantiation of the `basic_json` class template that uses `wchar_t` as the character type. The order of an object's name/value pairs is not preserved, they are sorted alphabetically by name. If you want to preserve the original insertion order, use [wojson](wojson.md) instead.

The `jsoncons` library will always rebind the supplied allocator from the template parameter to internal data structures.

#### Header
```c++
#include <jsoncons/json.hpp>
```
#### Interface

The interface is the same as [json](json), substituting wide character instantiations of classes - `std::wstring`, `std::wistream`, etc. - for utf8 character ones.

- [ojson](ojson.md) constructs a utf8 character json value that preserves the original insertion order of an object's name/value pairs
